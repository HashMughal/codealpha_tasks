This script builds a music recommendation system using three different approaches:

Lyrics-Based Recommendation:

Uses TF-IDF vectorization to analyze lyrics.
Computes cosine similarity between songs based on their lyrics.
Finds and recommends songs with the most similar lyrics.
Feature-Based Recommendation:

Uses numerical features like danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, etc.
Applies Min-Max Scaling to normalize these features.
Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find songs that have similar audio characteristics.
Genre-Based Recommendation:

Assigns songs into clusters based on their musical features.
Uses K-Means clustering to group similar songs.
Suggests songs from the same cluster as the given song.
Workflow:
Load and Merge Data:

The script loads two datasets:
spotify_millsongdata.csv (contains lyrics and audio features).
Music Info.csv (contains additional metadata).
Merges them using artist and song name.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Fills missing values for genres and tags.
Normalizes numerical features using MinMaxScaler.
Model Training & Recommendation Functions:

TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity: Finds similar songs based on lyrics.
KNN (Nearest Neighbors): Finds similar songs based on audio features.
K-Means Clustering: Groups songs into genre-based clusters.
Testing with Sample Songs:

The script generates recommendations for 14 popular songs.
Outputs recommendations for each song using all three methods.

Music Recommendation System
This project is all about recommending songs based on different approaches, making it easier to find music that matches your taste. The system takes a dataset of songs and artists, processes the data, and then suggests similar tracks using three different techniques.

How It Works
We start by loading two datasets:

One contains lyrics and song features (danceability, tempo, energy, etc.).
The other has additional details like genre and tags.
The datasets are merged to get a complete picture of each song. Any missing values are filled, and the numerical data (like loudness and tempo) is scaled to ensure consistency.

Three Ways to Recommend Songs
1Ô∏è‚É£ Lyrics-Based Recommendations:

The system analyzes song lyrics using a technique called TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
It then finds songs with similar word patterns and themes.
If two songs have similar lyrics, they will be recommended together.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature-Based Recommendations:

This approach looks at the actual musical characteristics of a song, such as danceability, energy, and tempo.
Using a method called K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), it finds songs that have similar audio features.
This helps in finding music that feels the same, even if the lyrics are completely different.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Genre-Based Recommendations:

Here, songs are grouped into clusters based on their musical features.
A machine learning algorithm called K-Means Clustering is used to sort songs into different "genre-like" categories.
If a user likes a song, other songs from the same cluster are recommended.
Final Touch ‚Äì Testing the System
To check if everything works, the system picks 14 well-known songs (like Bohemian Rhapsody and Shape of You) and generates three different sets of recommendations for each song. The results are printed in an easy-to-read format.

Why This Project Matters
This system makes song discovery easier by offering different ways to explore music. Whether you‚Äôre looking for songs with similar lyrics, the same musical vibe, or the same genre, this recommendation system has got you covered.
